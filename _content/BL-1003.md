## What is a REST API? {#What-is-a-REST-API}

![RESTful Architecture](/BL-1003/rest-architecture.jpg)


A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD operations on resources, typically represented in JSON format.

REST APIs are widely used in web development to connect frontend applications with backend services.

## Why Use Spring Boot for REST APIs? {#Why-Use-Spring-Boot-for-REST-APIs}


- **Quick Setup**: With Spring Initializr and Spring Boot starters, you can scaffold a REST API project in minutes.
- **Embedded Server**: No need for external deployment—just run and test your API instantly.
- **Spring MVC**: Powerful and flexible web framework included with Spring Boot.
- **Auto Configuration**: Simplifies development by handling a lot of the setup for you.

## Creating a Simple REST API {#Creating-a-Simple-REST-API}

To create a REST API in Spring Boot, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Project**: Use [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) and include dependencies like *Spring Web* and *Spring Boot DevTools.*

2. **Create a Model Class**:
   ```java
   public class Product {
       private Long id;
       private String name;
       private double price;
       // Getters and Setters
   }
   ```

3. **Create a REST Controller**:
   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/products")
   public class ProductController {
       private List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();

       @GetMapping
       public List<Product> getAllProducts() {
           return products;
       }

       @PostMapping
       public Product addProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
           products.add(product);
           return product;
       }
   }
   ```
   

4. **Run the Application**:
   Use `mvn spring-boot:run` or run from your IDE.

## Best Practices {#Best-Practices}

- Use `@RestController` instead of `@Controller + @ResponseBody`
- Version your APIs (e.g., `/api/v1/products`)
- Handle exceptions with `@ControllerAdvice`
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to control data exposure
- Secure your endpoints with Spring Security and JWT (optional)

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}


Spring Boot makes building REST APIs fast and efficient. With its rich ecosystem, easy setup, and support for modern web standards, it’s a top choice for Java developers building scalable backend services.
