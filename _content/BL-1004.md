## What is Spring Security? {#What-is-Spring-Security}

Spring Security is a powerful framework that focuses on providing authentication and authorization for Java applications. It is highly customizable and integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot.

Spring Security helps protect applications from common threats like unauthorized access, session fixation, CSRF, and more.

## Why Use Spring Security? {#Why-Use-Spring-Security}


- **Built-in Authentication**: Supports form login, basic auth, JWT, OAuth2, and LDAP.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Control access at method or endpoint level using roles.
- **Secure by Default**: Enforces strong security policies out of the box.
- **Customizable**: You can define your own user service, token filters, and security rules.

## Getting Started with Spring Security {#Getting-Started-with-Spring-Security}

1. **Add Dependency**:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Default Behavior**:
   After adding the dependency, all endpoints are secured by default with HTTP Basic authentication.

3. **Custom User Configuration**:
   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class SecurityConfig {
       @Bean
       public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
           http
               .csrf().disable()
               .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                   .requestMatchers("/api/public/**").permitAll()
                   .anyRequest().authenticated()
               )
               .httpBasic();
           return http.build();
       }

       @Bean
       public InMemoryUserDetailsManager userDetailsService() {
           UserDetails user = User
               .withUsername("admin")
               .password("{noop}password")
               .roles("ADMIN")
               .build();
           return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user);
       }
   }
   ```

## Common Security Techniques {#Common-Security-Techniques}

- **JWT Authentication**: Use JSON Web Tokens to secure REST APIs statelessly.
- **Password Encoding**:
   ```java
   @Bean
   public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
       return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
   }
   ```
- **Method-Level Security**:
   ```java
   @EnableMethodSecurity
   public class MethodSecurityConfig { }

   @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
   public void deleteUser(Long id) { ... }
   ```

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}


Spring Security is essential for building secure, production-ready applications. With built-in support for authentication and role-based access control, it enables you to protect both web and REST applications effectively.

Whether you're building a small app or a large-scale system, Spring Security gives you the tools to enforce robust security practices.
