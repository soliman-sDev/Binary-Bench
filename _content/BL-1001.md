## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? {#What-is-Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP}

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses **objects** and **classes** to organize code. Java is a fully object-oriented language that follows this model to promote modularity, reusability, and scalability.

OOP allows developers to structure programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

## Core Concepts of OOP in Java {#Core-Concepts-of-OOP-in-Java}

![OOP Concepts](/BL-1001/oop-concepts.webp)

### 1. Class and Object: {#1.-Class-and-Object}
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class.

```java
class Car {
    String model;
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.drive();
```

### 2. Encapsulation: {#2.-Encapsulation}
Wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit.

```java
public class User {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

### 3. Inheritance: {#3.-Inheritance}
Allows one class to inherit properties and methods of another.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

### 4. Polymorphism: {#4.-Polymorphism}
Enables methods to behave differently based on the object calling them.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Generic animal sound");
    }
}
class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}
```

### 5. Abstraction: {#5.-Abstraction}
Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features.

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing circle");
    }
}
```

## Why Use OOP in Java? {#Why-Use-OOP-in-Java}

- Promotes **code reusability** through inheritance
- Improves **data security** with encapsulation
- Enhances **maintainability** and **scalability**
- Allows **real-world modeling** using objects

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}


OOP is at the heart of Java development. Mastering its principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction enables you to write clean, organized, and efficient code that models real-world problems effectively.
